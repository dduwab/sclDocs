# Cloning Sprites
Cloning is one of the most powerful features of SCL. When you clone a sprite, the new sprite gets all the properties and alterations of the original sprite. You can clone a sprite as it was originally defined. A clone can be assigned a name using **as {cloneName}**, but this is optional. Immediately after you clone a sprite you can refer to the clone to make updates by using **_clone** instead of a sprite name, as in ```update sprite _clone where x=7``` 

```
create sprite from star.png as Star
  where x=30 y=30 angle=45 center=auto
  having alt=(sub create rotation end)
end
create routine as Start
  launch Star
  clone from Star using original
  update sprite _clone where image=heart.png
  update sprite _clone where x=130 and y=130
  clone from Star using original as Square
  update sprite _clone where image=square.png
  update sprite _clone where x=230 and y=230

  update sprite Square where size=2
end
```

You can assign a name to a clone using **as**: ```clone from Empty as Ducky using original```

If you name a clone then you can reference it like any other sprite. You should not assign a name if the same clone statement will be used repeatedly. 

Please note the **_clone** keyword. _clone always refers back to the most recently created clone. The value of _clone can be used until a new clone is created - even in other routines.

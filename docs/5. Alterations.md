# Alterations

Alterations apply a behaviour to a sprite. The first example below demonstrations how a rotation is added to a sprite. In the example, when the rotation ends it automatically attaches a reverse rotation, which in turn re-attaches the original rotation. The creates a back-and-forth rotation of the sprite.

```
create sprite from triangle.png as spinner
  where x=250 y=250 center=auto
  having alt=ThisWay
end
create routine as Start
  launch spinner
end
create rotation as ThisWay
  where speed=130 distance=135 completion=ThatWay
end
create rotation  as ThatWay 
  where speed=-130 distance=135 completion=ThisWay
end
```

> [!NOTE]
> Try out code samples at https://canvaslanguage.com/studio/github-examples.
> Paste the code samples into the box under that "Advanced" tab,
> then push the "Rec" button to view the animation.

All alterations have a **completion** property which can either specify the name of a routine, the name of an alteration, or a **sub** command. A **sub** command allows you to define an unnamed alteration or routine in-place.

For example:
```
create sprite from triangle.png as spinner
  where x=250 y=250 center=auto
  having alt=(sub
    create rotation as ThisWay
      where speed=130 distance=135 completion=(sub
    create rotation
      where speed=-130 distance=135 completion=ThisWay
    end) end)
end
create routine as Start
  launch spinner
end
```

# List of Alterations

The following alterations can be added to sprites.

**Bezier**
 - Move a sprite along a Bezier curve
**Fade**
 - Change the transparency of a sprite over a given timeframe
**Flipbook**
 - Change the image of the sprite over time, like a flipbook
**Pursuit**
 - Move one sprite towards another
**Range**
 - Triggers a completion event when another sprite enters a specified range
**Reveal**
 - Reveal a sprite from one of the four directions as if it is coming from behind an invisible wall
**Rotation**
 - Rotate a sprite around its center point
**Scale**
 - Scales a sprite over time
**Sheer**
 - Applies a shearing effect to the sprite
**Slide**
 - Slide a sprite in a given direction
**Translation**
 - Move a sprite to a given x/y coordinate
**Vector**
 - Move a sprite in the direction of its **angle** property
**Wait**
 - Waits don't alter a sprite, but instead act as a timer, calling a completion event when the time has elapsed

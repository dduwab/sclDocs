# Changing Sprite Properties

You can change just about any sprite value that you can set when a sprite is created. Do this with an 'update' command:

```update sprite {spritename} where {property}={value} and {property2}={value2} ...etc ```


A special feature of routines run this way is the special variable **_sprite**. _sprite contains a reference to the sprite that triggered the event handler. That way you can use the same routine for any sprite, without knowing the spriteâ€™s name. Simply use _sprite in place of the sprite name anywhere within the event handling routine.

Also note the inclusion of the word **and**. This is necessary to join several properties in a single **update** command.

Alternately, you can simply use several update commands:
```
update sprite {spritename} where {property}={value}
update sprite {spritename} where {property2}={value2}
```

# SCL Documentation

Structured Canvas Language (SCL) is an animation programming language. "Canvas Language" is fine, "SCL" is better.

Specificly, SCL is a 2D sprite animation language that is interpreted by JavaScript at runtime. Type the SCL into a <textarea> and run the animation - or implement in any number of other ways depending on the use-case.

To Start, this repo will document the language structure so that you can edit your SCL code whereever you may find it.
For example, here and here:

here 1: https://canvaslanguage.com/studio

here 2: https://editablegifs.com/


> [!NOTE]
> When provided, most code samples can be run at https://canvaslanguage.com/studio/github-examples.
> Paste the code samples into the box under that "Advanced" tab,
> then push the "Rec" button to view the animation.

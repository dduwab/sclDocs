# SCL Documentation

Structured Canvas Language (SCL) is an animation programming language. "Canvas Language" is fine, "SCL" is better.

Specificly, SCL is a 2D sprite animation language that is interpreted by JavaScript at runtime. Type the SCL into a <textarea> and run the animation - or implement in any number of other ways depending on the use-case.

To Start, this repo will document the language structure so that you can edit your SCL code whereever you may find it.
For example: here, here, and here.
